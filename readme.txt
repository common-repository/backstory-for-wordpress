== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have a small personal blog, can I use Backstory? =
Absolutely! Backstory works for any size or type of site to help you optimize you visitors' experience based on intent.

= Is Backstory free? =
There is a free version of Backstory available. Simply signup at [http://getbackstory.com](http://getbackstory.com "Backstory Homepage") and you'll be all set for up to 1500 unique visitors per month and allows you to create up to 3 rules at one time.

= What type of site platforms does Backstory work on? =
Since Backstory is activated with just a line or two of code in your site, any site on any platform can take advantage of our action analytics and real-time intent targeting. Take a look at our blog specific implementation guide and start today.

= Can I plug Backstory into one of my existing analytics platforms? =
We don’t yet automatically plug-in to other analytics platforms, but any site that has Backstory activated can take advantage of our own Action Analytics dashboard. Backstory gives a robust snapshot of a site’s best visitors allowing a site to immediately create targeting rules for different segments of visitors.

= What do you mean by “Action Analytics”? =
Backstory was created to allow sites to take immediate targeting action based on visitor intent. In order to make this a straightforward process, Backstory built an analytics engine that would allow sites to view their best visitors by a number of different criteria (referring site, social, # of visits, # of page views per visit, etc.). From these criteria, within seconds a site can create rules to target these visitors or their opposite. We call that Action Analytics.

= Can Backstory’s rules replace any content on my site to target visitors? =
Pretty much. We have two ways a rule can change your site. Use one of our default top or bottom bars to deliver a text message with a link –or- use our “custom” option to replace any div or span (`<div`> or `<span`>) on the destination page for your visitor matching the rule. It doesn’t matter if the content you are replacing is an image, text or a video for that matter – it will all work as long as you can identify the div or span in the page.

= How many rules can I have running at one time? =
All plans but our free version have unlimited rules. That means you can have no rules at all running and just use Backstory for our unique analytics OR fire as many as your marketing team can think of, to target even the most niche segments of visitors. Even stack rules at the same time (i.e. a visitor that has been here twice AND has been referred from travel keywords at least once). On average we see that sites use no more than a dozen rules at a time.
